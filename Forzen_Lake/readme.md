# Overview
The Frozen Lake Environment 6x6 will we be used to implement the reinforcement Learning :


# Agents Workflow
- The agent start from at the top left corner of the Lake.
- The goal is the agent have to reach to Bottom-right corener by avoiding the the holes .
- Utilizing the given Reinfrocement Learning MonteCarlo to given Enironment . 

# Requirements
- Python 3.x (or Greater)
- [OpenAi Gym]([https://gymnasium.farama.org/])
- [Frozen_Lake](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/))

# Installation 
- Install OpenAi Gym
  ``` bash
  git clone https://github.com/openai/gym 
-  Clone the Repository:
   ``` bash  
     git clone [(https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/)]

# Working

# Monte_Carlo 
Monte Carlo methods are ways of solving the reinforcement learning problem based on averaging sample returns. To ensure that well-defined returns are available, here we define Monte Carlo methods only for episodic tasks.
