# Maze Solving using DFS with Pyamaze

The project will show the impelmentation of Deep First Seach(DFS) using **Python** and **Maze** generation library for sort of better visualization.
This can be done by using **pymaze**

# Overview
The pyamaze will generates the gird of specification (for this project 10x10 has been used), and uses the DFS algorithm to get through it.

# Agents Workflow
- The agent start from at the bottom-right corner of the maze
- The goal is the agent have to reach to top-left corener while leaving a trail of footprints.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x (or Greater)
- [Pyamaze](https://github.com/MAN1986/pyamaze/blob/main/pyamaze/pyamaze.py)

# Installation 
-  Clone the Repository:
  ``` bash
